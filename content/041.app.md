### Proof-of-concept application

Our application demonstrates the workflow with a front-end for tree editing.
The updated data is then passed around in JSON format.
Our application's back-end handles modeling and hierarchy suggestion (and/or) term ranking.
The primary data structures of the back-end are adjacency matrices.


- Panel for visuals

- Discussion of challenges getting data "back into" model:
    - No options to retrieve data from Panel after being edited, except to export it. User can customize interface parameters but not data.

Brainstormed things to try, revisit this section once we make progress on the code:
- Use Panel as view-only of underlying data object
- Do everything functionally (React or ELM architecture)
- Create data object (e.g. wrapper class with input dataframes, output Panel object. Panel will callback to new instance of object once edited)
- Param → to make custom class
- Pydantic → gets JSON schema
