## Introduction

- Core problem: Create interface for tree structure which allows for continuous streaming of data. This exists for “regular” labeled data, but the existing methods don’t work on trees.
  - we want to extract trees from data, then provide efficient way for HITL to edit

- “No AI is an Island”, “Intelligence on Tap” → these papers suggest that AI can be used as a design material, could use these as basis to support our approach [@doi:10.1609/aimag.v40i1.2842; @doi:10.1145/3085571]
