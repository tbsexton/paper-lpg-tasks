### Technical Approaches

#### Hierarchy Generation



Discuss new categories/nodes formed beyond what is in original dataset
    - barnyard animal example
    - Steiner nodes created by TreeRep

[Discuss other possible approaches beyond our implementation.]


##### Hyperbolic Embeddings

- Main papers on Poincare and Lorentz are not recovering trees. They are showing that trees can transfer to continuous hyperbolic space
- Hyperbolic embeddings are smooth, gradients, can optimize by using gradient steps to modify tree and then evaluate changes (AlphaGo CNN approach)
- We want the opposite: extract hierarchy from data
  - Heymann heuristic (not as easily modified/regenerated because it is one-directional)
  - Entailment cones (has gradients, so this lends itself to ML)

- Unsupervised ML
- Could use reinforcement learning, but probably not best approach
