### Task Analysis


Task analysis for interactive software applications [@doi:10.1109/TSE.2002.1027801]:
    - "GOMS" = Goals, Operators, Methods, Selection Rules [@doi:10.1201/9780203736166]
      - GOMS approaches are typically sequential



To asses the process of creating a taxonomy, we performed a task analysis, 

- use TA to formulate goals, operators, task diagrams, design specs
- create diagram
- Task analysis of taxonomy creation itself
  - Potentially refer to procedure from Nickerson et al.  (iterative) [@doi:10.1057/ejis.2012.26]
  1.) Define meta-characteristic  
  2.) determine stopping conditions  
  3.) selecting an empirical-to-conceptual or conceptual-to-empirical approach  
  4.) Iterate  

- Cognitive models (select relevant theory as basis of approach)

Basic info about task analysis: (more in [@doi:10.1201/9781315156811])
- **Cognitive Task Analysis** is focused on understanding tasks that require decision-making, problem-solving, memory, attention and judgement.  
	- Provides syntactic structure for the description of each task and subtask  
	- Verbs to classify actions and give cognitive levels  
	- To create CTA:  
		- 1.) Create PTA/HTA  
		- 2.) Determine which tasks require cognitive skill  
		- 3.) Use taxonomies to assign verbs  
		-  
- **Hierarchical Task Analysis** is focused on decomposing a high-level task subtasks ()sequential and hierarchal), observable actions performed  
	- User goal  
	- Main tasks, subdivided into subtasks  
	- Stopping Rule  
	- Plan defines task order at each level  
	- To create HTA:  
		- 1.) Cluster tasks by similarity, overlap, labeling groups  
		- 2.) Organize tasks within each group as hierarchy  
		- 3.) Confer with expert (in parallel with first two steps)  
- **Procedural Task Analysis** : sequential, with decision making elements (multiple routes)  
	- Flowchart  
	- To create PTA, assemble:  
		- 1.) Start and End circle(s)  
		- 2.) Input/output tasks  
		- 3.) Process (do not require decision)  
		- 4.) Decisions  
- Hybrid versions: HTA can occur within one or more subtasks of the PTA OR PTA can occur within one or more subtasks of the HTA  


TA brainstorm for manual taxonomy formation, w/ Bloom's taxonomy 

| Cognitive Task |	Level |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Hypothesize top level parent nodes | Create |
| Locate parent node tokens	| Knowledge |
| Appraise each tag	| Evaluate |
| Categorize tag (based on top level)	| Analyze |
| Compare tag to others in that subtree	| Evaluate |
| Integrate tag into subtree	| Create |
