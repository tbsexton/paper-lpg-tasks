**Assimilation**: 
The original subtree is unchanged after the node "Duck" is added.

**Accommodation**: 
When the node "Cow" is included in the graph, the edge connecting it is deemed incorrect, either by a human-in-the-loop or machine learning.
The parent node is changed to "Farm Animals" in order to correct the schema so that it reflects reality. Accommodation modifies the original subtree.
