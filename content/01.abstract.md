## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Draft abstract from earlier version of this project, needs updated:
*Mining tag taxonomies from text data is a requisite for capturing semantic relations and modeling word associations. For example, organizing tag information in a hierarchy helps to structure valid groups of tags to describe a certain concept.
This process requires accounting for context to obtain structural information and find similarities to all potential predecessors of the parent in the taxonomy and define the subtags of a tag.
We propose methods to model word relationships and hierarchies using soft-cosine similarity calculations, skipgram collocation calculations, and hyperbolic embeddings to generate an initial tree model of a tag dataset.
Ultimately, human-in-the-loop is necessary for efficient and accurate structuring of data. Following the Technical Language Processing paradigm, we propose a workflow with human-in-the-loop editing of a modeled tag hierarchy, such that a domain expert can iterate on the generated hierarchy for a more custom result.
We also show that the proposed approach would suit the Grounded theory social science qualitative research. Using lessons from this methodology used to annotate notes and identify “anchors”, we demonstrate its potential as a bottom-up approach to data-driven theory generation.*
