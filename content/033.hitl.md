### Human-in-the-Loop

Human-centered AI

[@doi:10.1038/s42256-021-00393-0] describes a framework for incorporating human-in-the-loop for wildlife photo recognition. 
The researchers propose that artificial intelligence efforts should evaluate human effort efficiency rather than simple performance metrics when evaluating a model.
Initially, AI was seen as an opportunity for computers to automate human tasks, so the bar for a "successful" model is quite high.
Although AI models can perform with such high levels of accuracy, this typically requires large amounts of quality data. 
If we consider an AI effort as a loop of data collection, human annotation, and training,  analysts should optimize the human step. 
Human-centered AI offers a more practical approach to incorporating AI; modeling can be used as a tool to augment human efforts and vise-versa.
This perspective offers both the benefits of AI computation and the robustness of human input.
Most challenges for AI, such as label noise, are fairly straightforward for humans.
